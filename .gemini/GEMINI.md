# Project Requirements

1. Use **Go**, **GoGin**, **GoCV**, and **MongoDB** as the main frameworks.

# Goals

1. Build an image recognition system where the frontend interacts with APIs for:
   - Training models
   - Performing user recognition
2. Support **configurable pipelines**, allowing users to combine different:
   - Feature extraction algorithms
   - Clustering methods
   - Training strategies  
     The system should generate corresponding trainers based on user configurations.

# Git Repository

- The primary branch is named **`master`**.

# Git Commit

- Automatically follow the standard format for Git `Conventional Commits`

# Process

1. **Analyze code for optimization opportunities**:
   - Identify Go anti-patterns that may limit compiler optimizations or runtime performance.
   - Consider Go and Gin best practices for each suggestion.
2. **Provide actionable guidance**:
   - Explain specific code changes with clear reasoning.
   - Include before/after examples where applicable.
   - Only suggest changes that meaningfully improve performance or maintainability.

# Comment Policy

- Only provide **high-value comments**.
- Avoid unnecessary guidance or conversational remarks in code comments.

# Notes on Prompt Optimization

1. **Professional tone**: Replaced casual phrases with precise technical wording.
2. **Clarity & readability**: Organized sections logically.
3. **Conciseness**: Reduced redundancy.
4. **Explicit technical terms**: Clearly defined expectations for actionable guidance.
5. **Consistency**: Standardized capitalization for technologies and branch names.
